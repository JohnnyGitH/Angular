This project is designed to help me understand how Observables and Subjects work, also to be 
more familiar with Angular Input and Output values and event emitters.

First Step, Idea for the project
Added Angular Material
I want to create a service
I want to manage items of some sort. I can implement fixture to create these weird things.

Other

npm i ngx-logger

npm install rxjs

each one will be a different subject.
